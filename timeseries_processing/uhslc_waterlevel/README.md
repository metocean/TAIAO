# Processing of the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center water level data for New Zealand

First we would like to acknowledge the [Sea Level Centre from the University of Hawaii](https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/datainfo/) for the research quality data for multiple sites in New Zealand that we have been able to use as part of our project. Their dataset information is published here:

Caldwell, P. C., M. A. Merrifield, P. R. Thompson (2015), Sea level measured by tide gauges from global oceans â€” the Joint Archive for Sea Level holdings (NCEI Accession 0019568), Version 5.5, NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, Dataset, doi:10.7289/V5V40S7W.

The UHSLC data was processed using the code that we made openly available in a Jupyter notebook as part of the [TAIAO platform](https://taiao.ai/). The interested use can find the notebook at the following [location](https://github.com/metocean/TAIAO/blob/master/data_connectors/uhslc_connectors/uhslc_connector.ipynb).
